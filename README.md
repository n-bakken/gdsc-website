# Google Developer Student Club Website

## Senior Project by Nora Bakken, Sianna Mucino, and Howard Lee

### This README file serves as an overview of our senior project, to give the reader a perspective of where certain functions were implemented, and why we chose some of the solutions and tech stacks we ended up using. For any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to [Nora](n_bakken@u.pacific.edu)

### Why REACT?

We wanted to create a responsive and visually pleasing web application that would be an attractive asset to our portfolios. Employers often identify REACT as a skill they would like to see in potential hires, making it a good option for us as soon-to-be graduates.

### Why Amazon Web Services?

We originally wanted to host our website on Pacific's web server. Unfortunately, because our website was created with REACT and was therefore a Javascript application, it was not easily hostable from a File Transfer Protocol system. We looked into simple and cost effective solutions for hosting a REACT app, and AWS was highly regarded as a simple solution which even supported continuous integration.

### Why Firebase?

Firebase, Google's backend/database solution, was able to provide everything we needed for our project including large and small data storage, user authentication, and a realtime database. It also interacted well with AWS.

# Our Code

### This section will provide an overview of the important files in our codebase. A short description will be provided regarding each file. For more information, comments will be provided throughout relevant files. We will not provide comments or descriptions of default files for dependencies, or those that came with the REACT project--we will only comment on those that we wrote.

## Public 
### Laptop Directory
This directory provides all of the necessary resources to display the 3D model of a laptop with our logo on our homepage. 

### images Directory
This directory houses all of the images we use on our website.

### index.html
This file works similarly to any other index file for a webpage; it is the first file that the browser loads when a request to view the website is made. While this file was mostly generated by REACT upon creating the project, we do use it to load our homepage and to ensure that our custom font is loaded across all pages. 

## src
### Components / Pages:
#### Backend
This directory is mainly to assist in the functionality of the admin page, which uploads potentially large files to our Firebase database.
#### Auth:
This directory houses the files which interact with the user authentication component in Firebase. 
##### Login.jsx
This file serves to provide the frontend code for the login page, and provides the logic to make a call to Firebase to verify the email and password combination entered by the user. 
##### Register.jsx
This file is very similar to Login.jsx, but instead provides the logic to make a call to Firebase to first ensure that a user does not exist with the inputted email address, and then securely create a new account with the credentials provided. 
#### css
This directory houses all of the `.css` files used with our web application. We will not go into great detail regarding this, as the code is quite readable and only delivers the styling for the website and no logic. 
#### About.jsx
This file provides a static page with information about the core club members of GDSC.
#### Admin.jsx
This file provides both the frontend and backend logic for the existence of the Admin page, which is the page for core members to be able to upload club materials and view information about users. This page is only intended to be seen by the core members of GDSC and will not be accessible to regular users of the website. 
#### ContactUs.jsx
This file provides a form which users can fill out and send an email to a core member of GDSC. This would be good for someone who does not have a Discord account or does not want to commit to joining a server. This file includes the use of the EmailJS API to send emails to gdsc.uop@gmail.com. 
#### Dropdown.jsx
This file includes the logic to support a dynamic dropdown menu to extend the Navbar, in the event that future developers would like to create more pages for the website. 
#### EventData.jsx and EventPage.jsx
These files exist to provide the user with a dynamic list of upcoming GDSC events. It will reflect events added via the admin page, and sort them by tag. 
#### Footer.jsx
This file supports the running footer that is shown across all pages of the website. We made it it's own file so that any `.jsx` file can utilize this as a simple line: `<Footer></Footer>`. We had a similar strategy with the Navbar.
