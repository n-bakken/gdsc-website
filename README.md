## Senior Project by Nora Bakken, Sianna Mucino, and Howard Lee

### This README file serves as an overview of our senior project, to give the reader a perspective of where certain functions were implemented, and why we chose some of the solutions and tech stacks we ended up using. For any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to [Nora](n_bakken@u.pacific.edu)

### Why REACT?

We wanted to create a responsive and visually pleasing web application that would be an attractive asset to our portfolios. Employers often identify REACT as a skill they would like to see in potential hires, making it a good option for us as soon-to-be graduates.

### Why Amazon Web Services?

We originally wanted to host our website on Pacific's web server. Unfortunately, because our website was created with REACT and was therefore a Javascript application, it was not easily hostable from a File Transfer Protocol system. We looked into simple and cost effective solutions for hosting a REACT app, and AWS was highly regarded as a simple solution which even supported continuous integration.

### Why Firebase?

Firebase, Google's backend/database solution, was able to provide everything we needed for our project including large and small data storage, user authentication, and a realtime database. It also interacted well with AWS.
